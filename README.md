### Abstract
Convergent Antisense (CAS) transcription is a prevalent and evolutionary conserved class of non-coding transcription in eukaryotes. It occurs on the complementary strand of coding regions in the genome and is initiated in the 5ʹ-end of their host genes. Here, we characterize CAS transcription and their host genes in Arabidopsis. Interestingly, CAS transcription is associated with stress responsive genes that are highly expressed in Arabidopsis, in contrast to metazoans where it is associated with lowly expressed genes. Our analysis shows that CAS transcription depends on a specific gene architecture, with an extended first intron that is present at specific members of AAP transporters. Experimental evidence points to a role for CAS transcription to prime genes for stress-responsiveness in plants. Furthermore, we were able to predict stress responsiveness in AAP rice genes, based on the presence of a long first intron and CAS transcription. Overall, we show an evolutionary conserved strategy in plants for enhancing stress responsiveness through modification of gene architecture and antisense transcription.
